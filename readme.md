###Algorithm

This uses a super-secret hyper-intelligent neural network algorithm recovered from Soviet submarine navigation computers that definitely **doesn't** just check for adjacent matching tiles and makes a random move if it can't find any. As per the Столи́чная act of 1973, you are hereby forbidden from looking at the algorithm in ai.js. Non-compliance is punishable by 10 years forced labour in Siberia.

###But will it win?

I think I saw it get to 512 once, I dunno.

###It isn't working!

If you're using a recent version of Firefox or Chrome, file an issue. If you're not, find a large stick and whack yourself on the head until you smarten up.
